#Algebra 1 Overview Notes:

1.) Linear Equations and Inequalities
- Highest power of variable: 1
	- Example: 2x + 5 = 11
	- Solution: Isolate x.

- Linear Equations:
	- Standard form: ax + by = c
	- Slope-nitercept form: y = mx + b
		- m = rise / run
		- by = y-intercept

	- Graph: Always a straight line.
	- Ineqaulities: Symbols: <,<=,>,>=
		- Flip sign if multiplying/dividing by a negative.
		- Graphing: Shade above/below line.

2.) System of Equations:
- Definition: Solving 2+ equations together. Solution = Intersect Point.
- Methods:
	- Graphing.
	- Subsitution.
	- Elimination.
- Possible Outcomes:
	- One Solution -> Lines Cross
	- No Solution -> Lines Parallel
	- Infinite Solution -> Same Line.

3.) Quadratic
- Standard form: ax^2 + bx + x = 0
- Graph: Parabola
	- a > 0: opens up
	- a < 0: opens down
- Features:
	- Vertex = max/min
	- Axis of symmetry: x = -b/2a
	- Roots = x - intercepts

- Solving:
	1. Factoring
	2. Completely square
	3. Quadratic Formula:     x = -b +- b^2 - 4ac / 2a

- Discriminant: b^2 - 4ac
	- > 0:2 real roots
	- = 0: 1 real roots
	- 0 : complex roots



4. Exponents, Radicals, Polynomials
- Exponents:
	- a^m x a^n = a^m+n
	- a^m/a^n = a^m-n
	- (a^m)^n = a^mn
	- a^0 = 1

- Polynomials:
- Expression with terms: ax^n - factor using GCF
	- Degree = largest exponent




5. Functions and Notation:
- Definition and Notation: Relation where each input -> exactly one output.
- Notation: f(x). Example: f(x) = 2x + 3 . If x = 4. The f(x) = 11.
- Domain: all inputs (x-values)
- Range all outputs (y-values)
- Vertical line test: touches graph once - function.


6. Absolute Value Equations and Inequalties:
- Absolute value: distance from 0. Always >= 0.
- Equations example: 1x - 31 = 5 . x -3 = 5 or x - 3 = -5 

- Inequalities: |x| < a -> -a < x < a
